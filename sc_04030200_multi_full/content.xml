YOUR USE OF NOT-FOR-RESALE SOFTWARE IS AT YOUR OWN RISK.  SEE SECTIONS 5(b) AND 6 for WARRANTY DISCLAIMERS AND LIABILITY LIMITATIONS WHICH GOVERN NOT-FOR-RESALE SOFTWARE.

(e) Authorized Users.  For each software license You have purchased SlickEdit assigns You a unique serial number and user count based on the number of licenses you have purchased.   The user count assigned to this serial number designates the number of persons "Authorized Users" that are authorized to use the Software according to the terms of this Agreement.  Please refer to the Registered Products page of the SlickEdit website (www.slickedit.com) for a display of Your Authorized Users for this license purchase.  If you cannot access the Registered Products page, please contact SlickEdit Sales to verify Your Authorized Users.  Unless expressly stated otherwise, the Software may not be separated for use by more than the one unique designated User per Authorized User. Specifically:

(i) If You are an individual, SlickEdit grants to You as the User a personal, nonexclusive license to use the Software in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, provided that You are the only individual using the Software.

(ii) If You are an entity, SlickEdit grants to You the right to designate one User per Authorized User (i.e., on a one-for-one basis) within Your organization to have the sole right to use the Software  under each such license in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.  You may change such individual within Your organization any number of times, but not more than one time every 90 days. 

(f)   Additional Computer Use:  Software provided to You under this license may only be installed on any computer owned or controlled by You, but in no event shall the software license be used by You or the designated User, if You are an entity, on more than one computer at the same time.  Except as otherwise provided in this Section 1(f), a license for the Software may not be shared, installed or used concurrently on different computers.  

(g)  Slick-C(R) Code.  You may modify the Slick-C Macro Code ("Slick-C Code") included in the Software solely for the purposes of designing, developing and testing applications developed using SlickEdit software programs; provided, however, You are permitted to copy and distribute the Slick-C Code (modified or unmodified) only if all of the following conditions are met: (1) You distribute the compiled object Slick-C Code with Your application; (2) You do not include the Slick-C Code in any product or application designed for software development; and (3) You do not use the SlickEdit name, logos or other SlickEdit trademarks to market Your application. You agree to indemnify, hold harmless and defend SlickEdit from and against any loss, damage, claims or lawsuits, including attorney's fees, that arise or result from the use or distribution of Your application. 

2. Restrictions.  You may not transfer the Software to another entity or person. Any such transfer terminates Your license under this Agreement. Except with respect to the Slick-C Code as expressly set forth in Section 1(g), You shall not (i) modify, translate, reverse engineer or reverse compile in whole or in part the Software, (ii) rent, sell, time-share, lease, sublicense, transfer, publish, disclose, display or otherwise make available the Software or copies thereof to others and (iii) copy the Software except as provided herein. You shall not tamper with, bypass or alter any security features of the Software or attempt to do so. You agree that SlickEdit may audit Your use of the Software for compliance with these terms at any time, upon reasonable notice. In the event that such audit reveals any use of the Software by You other than in full compliance with the terms of this Agreement, You shall reimburse SlickEdit for all reasonable expenses related to such audit in addition to any other liabilities You may incur as a result of such non-compliance.

3. Intellectual Property Ownership.  The license of the Software is not a sale. Title, ownership rights, and intellectual property rights in and to the Software and Documentation shall remain in SlickEdit. You agree to abide by the copyright laws and all other applicable laws of the United States. You acknowledge that the Software in source code remains a confidential trade secret of SlickEdit. Failure to comply with the above restrictions will result in automatic termination of this license and will make available to SlickEdit other legal remedies. You may not disclose any of SlickEdit's proprietary or trade secret information relating to the Software to any third party. You agree to secure and protect the Software, Documentation and copies thereof in a manner consistent with the maintenance of SlickEdit's rights therein and to take appropriate action by instruction or agreement with Your employees or consultants who are permitted access to the Software to satisfy Your obligations hereunder. You may make one copy of the Software for backup or archival purposes in support of Your permitted use of the Software.

4.  Maintenance and Support. 

(a)  Error Correction and Technical Support.

(b)  Updates.  During the term of this Agreement, SlickEdit shall make available to You on SlickEdit's web site, any new releases, revisions, corrections, and upgrades of the Software that are made available free of charge by SlickEdit to its other licensees of the Software ("Updates").  You may download Updates by following SlickEdit's then-current procedures set forth on its web site.  Updates do not include new software that (i) port Software to new hardware or software platforms, or (ii) which provide significant new functionality on new hardware or software platforms.  By installing, copying, or otherwise using Updates, You agree to be bound by this Agreement and any modified and/or additional license terms, if any, that specifically add to or modify this Agreement and accompany or are provided with respect to such Updates. If You do not agree to the additional and/or modified license terms that accompany or are provided with respect to such Updates, You may not install, copy, or use such Updates.

(c)  Cooperation.  You shall provide SlickEdit with sufficient documentation, information, assistance, support and test time on Your computer system as necessary, to duplicate the problem, certify that the problem is with the Software, and certify that the problem has been corrected.  You shall perform Error definition activities, and any remedial or corrective actions, as described in the Software user manuals and other system documentation provided to You by SlickEdit, prior to seeking assistance from SlickEdit.

(d)  Exclusions.

You may change such individual within Your organization any number of times, but not more than one time every 90 days. 

(f)   Additional Computer Use:  Software provided to You under this license may only be installed on any computer owned or controlled by You, but in no event shall the software license be used by You or the designated User, if You are an entity, on more than one computer at the same time.

In addition, SlickEdit shall not be responsible for services relating to: (i) any hardware or peripheral devices; (ii) recreation or reentry of data lost for any reason whatsoever; (iii) performance of the generalized duties of a network administrator; or (iv) performance of the generalized duties of a software developer engaged to create miscellaneous software applications.

5. WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER.

Your exclusive remedy under the preceding section is to return the Software to the place You acquired it, with a copy of Your receipt and a description of the problem. Provided that any non-compliance with the above warranty is reported in writing to SlickEdit no more than thirty (30) days following delivery to You, SlickEdit will use reasonable commercial efforts to supply You with a replacement copy of the Software that substantially conforms to the documentation, provide a replacement for defective media, or refund to You Your purchase price for the Software, at its option. SlickEdit shall have no responsibility if the Software has been altered in any way, if the media has been damaged by misuse, accident, abuse, modification or misapplication, or if the failure arises out of use of the Software with other than a recommended hardware configuration. Any such misuse, accident, abuse, modification or misapplication of the Software will void the warranty above. THIS REMEDY IS THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY AVAILABLE TO YOU FOR BREACH OF EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES WITH RESPECT TO THE SOFTWARE. THIS LIMITED WARRANTY DOES NOT APPLY TO UPDATES, EVALUATION, TRIAL, OR NOT FOR RESALE COPIES OF SOFTWARE. 

(b) DISCLAIMER.  EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN SECTION 5(a) ABOVE, SLICKEDIT MAKES NO OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO THE SOFTWARE, DOCUMENTATION AND SERVICES AND SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. SLICKEDIT DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE OPERATION OF THE SOFTWARE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE.  NO RIGHTS OR REMEDIES REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE 2A OF THE UCC WILL BE CONFERRED ON YOU UNLESS EXPRESSLY GRANTED HEREIN. THE SOFTWARE IS NOT DESIGNED, INTENDED OR LICENSED FOR USE IN HAZARDOUS ENVIRONMENTS REQUIRING FAIL-SAFE CONTROLS, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE DESIGN, CONSTRUCTION, MAINTENANCE OR OPERATION OF NUCLEAR FACILITIES, AIRCRAFT NAVIGATION OR COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS, AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL, AND LIFE SUPPORT OR WEAPONS SYSTEMS. SLICKEDIT SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY OF FITNESS FOR SUCH PURPOSES. 

(c) NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY SLICKEDIT, ITS DEALERS, DISTRIBUTORS, AGENTS OR EMPLOYEES SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY OR IN ANY WAY INCREASE THE SCOPE OF ANY WARRANTY PROVIDED HEREIN.

You may change such individual within Your organization any number of times, but not more than one time every 90 days. 

(f)   Additional Computer Use:  Software provided to You under this license may only be installed on any computer owned or controlled by You, but in no event shall the software license be used by You or the designated User, if You are an entity, on more than one computer at the same time.

2. Restrictions.  You may not transfer the Software to another entity or person. Any such transfer terminates Your license under this Agreement.
