<h3><font color="darkblue"><a name="important_notes">Important Notes</a></font></h3>

<p>
<b>1. Java Requirements</b><br>
SlickEdit Core v4.3 for Eclipse requires Java 5 or later.
</p>

<p>
<b>2. Linux Requirements</b><br>
The Linux version of SlickEdit Core v4.3 for Eclipse requires that libXp is installed.
</p>

<p>
<b>3. Source Lookup and GDB</b><br>

Since GDB 6.3, a <b>fullpath</b> attribute has been added which is used by the CDT for 
source lookup. This may result in a source lookup error when using breakpoints 
in C/C++ code. In the case of a "Source not found" error when the Eclipse 
debugger stops at a breakpoint, go to <b>Window &gt; Preferences &gt; C/C++ &gt; 
Debug &gt; Common Source Lookup Path</b> and create a new Path Mapping from <font face="Courier,Courier New">\cygdrive\c</font> 
to <font face="Courier,Courier New">c:\</font>.
</p>

<p>
<b>4. JDT Real-Time Errors in SlickEdit Core</b><br>
If a Java file is currently open in the standard Eclipse Java editor, and then explicitly opened  
again in SlickEdit, the original Eclipse Java editor will be flagged as modified.  This problem is most 
noticeable on Windows XP.  If <b>Window &gt; Preferences &gt; Java &gt; Editor &gt; Report problems as you type</b> 
is turned off, this problem will not occur.

<h3><font color="darkblue"><a name="enhancements">Product Enhancements</a></font></h3>
This section describes the new features and enhancements in SlickEdit Core v4.3.


<ul>
    <li><b>Linux 64-bit architecture now supported</b></li>
    <ul>
        <li>SlickEdit Core for Eclipse is now available in both 32 and 64 bit architectures on both Windows and Linux
    </ul>
    <li><b>New User Interface Architecture</b></li>
    <ul>
        <li>This release incorporates a reworked user interface architecture into all of our supported platforms
        <li>While the overall look and feel of SlickEdit is not greatly changed, there are enhancements to many dialogs and controls
        <li>The open/save file dialogs on Linux systems are greatly improved
    </ul>
    <li><b>Beautifier Enhancements</b></li>
    <ul>
        <li>SlickEdit now features a new beautifier framework for C/C++ and Objective-C
        <li>See the "Formatting" section of the C/C++ or Objective-C language options, or you can search for "beautify" in the Options dialog
        <li>You can use any of the existing profiles, or modify a profile that most closely matches your preferences and save it
        <li>Java, JavaScript, and other languages will be migrated to use the new beautifier in future releases
    </ul>
   <li><b>Expanded Auto-Complete Facility</b></li>
    <ul>
        <li>The list members functionality of Context Tagging&reg; has been integrated into Auto-Complete so that there is one consistent symbol completion interface and one set of options for symbol completion</li>
        <li>Auto-complete will show function prototypes when you narrow the list down to a small set of functions, allowing you to choose which overloaded function you want to call and then go immediately into function argument help for that function</li>
        <li>The options for syntax expansion and alias expansion have been moved to the language-specific Auto-Complete options page so that all completion options can be configured from one unified location</li>
    </ul>
    <li><b>Document Overview Bar</b></li>
    <ul>
        <li>When using the SlickEdit Search facility, and choosing the "Highlight all Matches" option, a slim gutter area next to the scrollbar will appear showing the relative location of all matches</li>
		<li>Clicking on the hotspot links in the overview bar will take you directly to that location in the file.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><b>Improved Objective-C language support</b></li>
    <ul>
        <li>Auto-completion, context tagging, and formatting of Objective-C has been greatly improved</li>
        <li>Objective-C has been incorporated into the new Beautifier framework</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<hr size="4">
<h3><font color="darkblue"><a name="known_limits">Known Limitations</a></font></h3>
<p>The following is a list of known limitations with existing features:</p>

<h4>XML Outline View</h4>
    <ul>
        <li type="square">
            This view will only work with files that SlickEdit recognizes specifically as XML.  Therefore, 
            Ant and HTML files will not work with this feature, even though they are technically XML.
        </li>
    </ul>

<h4>Linked Files and the Remote Systems Explorer plugin</h4>
    <ul>
        <li type="square">SlickEdit Core does not support opening or tagging any files opened from a linked 
			directory created with the Remote Systems Explorer plugin.
        </li>
        <li type="square">Using the <b>Current Project</b> location with SlickEdit Search will not search
			linked directories which have been added to the project.
        </li>
    </ul>
    
<h4>Vera Language Support</h4>
    <ul>
        <li type="square">
            Dereferencing and code completion of port members (portname.$member) does not yet understand the $ syntax.
        </li>
        <li type="square">
            Tagging of coverage_group and constraint implicit members is not complete.
        </li>
        <li type="square">
            Code that makes heavy use of the preprocessor (especially preprocessor macros) may not be parsed correctly.
        </li>
    </ul>

<h4>System Verilog Language Support</h4>
    <ul>
        <li type="square">
            SystemVerilog tagging does not currently support full preprocessing.  'define macros are not expanded, 
            some code may not parse correctly.
        </li>
        <li type="square">
            Built-in methods for variable queues or associative arrays (byte Q[$]; byte A[*]) may be 
            tagged as unknown methods, and you may not get correct auto-completions.
        </li>
        <li type="square">
            Tagging and color-coding for some built-in methods, compiler directives and preprocessing directives 
            may be incomplete.
        </li>
        <li type="square">
            Additionally, Verilog support updated to IEEE Standard 1364-2005 spec.
        </li>
    </ul>

<h4>Source Diff</h4>
    <ul>
        <li type="square">This feature was formerly known as "Code Diff". Please 
            note that the name has been changed in all documentation.
        </li>
        <li type="square">As this is a new feature, there may be times where it 
            fails to handle two files properly. Whenever possible if we can have 
            copies of these files it will help.
        </li>
        <li type="square">When you select Tools > File Difference, you will be 
            prompted whether you want to use Source Diff or not. You can switch 
            between Source Diff and regular diff, line-oriented diff using an 
            icon on the DIFFzilla dialog.
        </li>
    </ul>

<h4>Miscellaneous</h4>
    <ul>
		<li type="square">
		  Unattended installation is not supported.
		</li>
	    <li type="square">
	      SlickEdit Core Search/Replace only works correctly when searching a SlickEdit Core buffer.
	    </li>
	    <li type="square">
	      On some Linux distributions, primarily Red Hat Enterprise 4, closing a SlickEdit 
	      Core window (such as the Calculator or Regex Evaluator) with the "X" in the top 
	      right-hand corner may result in a crash. This is due to compatibility problems 
	      with certain versions of GTK+ (namely 2.4.13). It is recommended that you 
	      upgrade to at least GTK+ 2.8.
	    </li>
        <li type="square">
            X-Server limitations (UNIX platforms): When remotely displaying SlickEdit to a 
            Microsoft Windows platform, the free Cygwin XFree86&reg; X-Server does not work 
            well. We recommend using a more robust commercial X-Server, such as Hummingbird&reg; 
            Exceed&reg; or Reflection&reg; X.
        </li>
        <li type="square">
            Inline DTDs in XML documents are not always tagged properly.
        </li>
        <li type="square">
            JSP&trade; global variables are not picked up by tagging when declared inside <font face="Courier,Courier New">.jsp</font> 
            files.
        </li>
        <li type="square">
            XML files that use schemas do not have their entities picked up for color coding 
            when the root tag specifies both <b>xmlns</b> and <b>xsi:schemaLocation</b> 
            attributes. Also, multiple space-delimited values for <b>xsi:schemaLocation</b> 
            do not work.
        </li>
        <li type="square">
            If you have a Java class that has two local classes with the same name, you 
            cannot set debug breakpoints on the second class.
        </li>
        <li type="square">
            For performance reasons, Java Auto Import will only attempt to import class 
            names that start with a capital letter. This behavior can be changed by setting <b>def_jrefactor_auto_import_lowcase_identifiers</b> 
            to "1".
        </li>
    </ul>

<h4>Use of code from org.eclipse.ui.tests.dnd</h4>
<p>
Object code from the <b>org.eclipse.ui.tests.dnd</b> package is used for programatically 
splitting editor windows in Eclipse.  It is governed by the following license:
</p>

<p>THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
PUBLIC LICENSE (&quot;AGREEMENT&quot;). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR
DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS
AGREEMENT.</p>

<p><b>1. DEFINITIONS</b></p>

<p>&quot;Contribution&quot; means:
<ol type="a">
  <li>
    in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial
    code and documentation distributed under this Agreement, and
  </li>
  <li>
    in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
  </li>
</ol>
<ol type="i">
  <li>
    changes to the Program, and
  </li>
  <li>
    additions to the Program;
    <p>where such changes and/or additions to the Program
    originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A
    Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the
    Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such
    Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the
    Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in
    conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii)
    are not derivative works of the Program.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>&quot;Contributor&quot; means any person or entity that distributes
the Program.</p>

<p>&quot;Licensed Patents&quot; mean patent claims licensable by a
Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its
Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.</p>

<p>&quot;Program&quot; means the Contributions distributed in accordance
with this Agreement.</p>

&quot;Recipient&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under
this Agreement, including all Contributors.</p>

<p><b>2. GRANT OF RIGHTS</b></p>
<ol type="a">
  <li>
    Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each
    Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide,
    royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works
    of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the
    Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in
    source code and object code form.
  </li>
  <li>
    Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each
    Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide,
    royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell,
    offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such
    Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent
    license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the
    Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor,
    such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered
    by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
    combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
    licensed hereunder.
  </li>
  <li>
    Recipient understands that although each Contributor
    grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances
    are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
    patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each
    Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by
    any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights
    or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses
    granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to
    secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For
    example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient
    to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire
    that license before distributing the Program.
  </li>
  <li>
    Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it
    has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
    the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
  </li>
</ol>

<p><b>3. REQUIREMENTS</b></p>

<p>A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code
form under its own license agreement, provided that:</p>

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    it complies with the terms and conditions of this
    Agreement; and
  </li>
  <li>
    its license agreement:
  </li>
</ol>
<ol type="i">
  <li>
    effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors
    all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties
    or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or
    conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;
  </li>
  <li>
    effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors
    all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
    incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
  </li>
  <li>
    states that any provisions which differ from this
    Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other
    party; and
  </li>
  <li>
    states that source code for the Program is available
    from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a
    reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software
    exchange.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>When the Program is made available in source code form:</p>
<ol type="a">
  <li>
    it must be made available under this Agreement; and
  </li>
  <li>
    a copy of this Agreement must be included with each
    copy of the Program.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained
within the Program.</p>

<p>Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its
Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent
Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.</p>

<p><b>4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION</b></p>

<p>Commercial distributors of software may accept certain
responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the
like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of
the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial
product offering should do so in a manner which does not create
potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor
includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor
(&quot;Commercial Contributor&quot;) hereby agrees to defend and
indemnify every other Contributor (&quot;Indemnified Contributor&quot;)
against any losses, damages and costs (collectively &quot;Losses&quot;)
arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third
party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the
acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its
distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The
obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses
relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In
order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify
the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the
Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial
Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The
Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own
expense.</p>

<p>For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
defend claims against the other Contributors related to those
performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other
Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor
must pay those damages.</p>

<p><b>5. NO WARRANTY</b></p>

<p>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS
PROVIDED ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY
OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely
responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and
distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its
exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to
the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws,
damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or
interruption of operations.</p>

<p><b>6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY</b></p>

<p>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT
NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,
INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING
WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF
LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING
NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR
DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED
HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>

<p><b>7. GENERAL</b></p>

<p>If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action
by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum
extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.</p>

<p>If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other
software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such
Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the
date such litigation is filed.</p>

<p>All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time
after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights
under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and
distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However,
Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by
Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.</p>

<p>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this
Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is
copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The
Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including
revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the
Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse
Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may
assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a
suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be
given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including
Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the
Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version
of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the
Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as
expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no
rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under
this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or
otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this
Agreement are reserved.</p>

<p>This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and
the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party
to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more
than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its
rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.</p>
